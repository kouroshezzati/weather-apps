Solution Overview:

To meet the requirements of the assignment, I created two separate projects: 
one for the landing page using vanilla JavaScript and another for a weather forecasting 
app built with React. The weather app calculates the four-day weather forecast for the 
user's current location. This forecast data is then refined and sent to the landing page, 
which acts as the parent app, via an embedded iframe.

The iframe is used to dynamically load the weather app, and communication between the two 
apps is handled using the postMessage() method. The landing page has a message receiver to 
capture the data from the weather app and display the forecast information seamlessly.
